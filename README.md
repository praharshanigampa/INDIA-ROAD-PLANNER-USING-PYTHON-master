In this project, we build upon several techniques in order to create a simple Navigation-like route planner in Python.
 We will retrieve India's road network data from the 
Roads | data.gov.in
https://data.gov.in/sector/roads
 in order to find shortest paths in the road network graph. This will allow us to display road itineraries between any two locations in India.
